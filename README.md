# Stack-Based Language Interpreter

## Overview

This project is an interpreter for a stack-based programming language that supports basic arithmetic operations, control flow, and lambda calculus constructs. The interpreter is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy addition of new features and commands. I developed this interpreter as the final project for CS320: Concepts of Programming Languages at Boston University.

## Features

- **Stack Operations**: Supports push, pop, and basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- **Control Flow**: Implements conditional statements and let bindings.
- **Lambda Calculus**: Allows for function definitions and applications.
- **Parser Combinators**: Utilizes parser combinators for flexible and maintainable parsing logic.
- **Error Handling**: Provides basic error handling for invalid commands and syntax errors.
